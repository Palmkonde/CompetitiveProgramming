# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my journey through competitive programming, primarily using C and C++. The projects and files here are a reflection of my efforts and learning experiences across various platforms, including the Thailand Olympiad in Informatics.

Please note that these are not solutions but my personal work, with some files still incomplete or not yet started. You'll also find a few empty filesâ€”just a part of the process, haha.

Each folder is named after the corresponding website or platform. If you're interested, you can easily search for them online to explore further!
